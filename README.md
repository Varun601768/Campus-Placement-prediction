The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts
a student's likelihood of securing a job during campus placements. The model aims to
analyze various factors such as academic performance, work experience, technical skills,
and aptitude to determine placement probability and estimate the expected salary. By
leveraging historical placement data, the system can provide valuable insights to students,
helping them improve their employability. The model considers several key features to
make accurate predictions. Academic performance, including high school, undergraduate,
and postgraduate marks, plays a crucial role in determining eligibility. Work experience,
including internships and previous job roles, is another critical factor.
The expected outcome of this project is to provide students with predictive insights about
their placement chances and potential salary offers. By analyzing their strengths and
weaknesses, students can take proactive measures to enhance their skills and improve their
employability. The system can also assist universities and placement cells in identifying atrisk students and offering targeted career guidance. Ultimately, this machine learning-based
approach aims to optimize the campus placement process and support students in securing
better job opportunities
